# Notes for JS seminar

HTML- Used for structure
CSS- Used for style
JS- Used for user interaction

## Session One
Whenever we refer to  or see document (document.querySelector) in the code it is referring to the 'DOM'.

DOM- (document object model) - an actual object in the browser that we want to manipulateby using javaScript.

QUERYSELECTOR- What we use to grab instances of the code we are working with.
    * Use querySelector when getting single instance
    * Use querySelectorAll when getting every instance on page

. = class
(#) = id

PAGINATION- a way to limit the amount of things you are getting and also a way to specify in list where you are getting items from (like the 5000 photos on the jsonPlaceholder website) "get me 20 of these things from index 0-5 and 15-30"
